Therefore, it shall be the only translation used by the Church. All issues of interpretation and meaning shall be determined by the Pastor. (2 Tim. 3:16-17; 2 Pet. 1:20-21; Psalms 12:6-7; 100:5)",

Therefore the church as a group, or as any sub-group, (i.e. youth, teens, ladies 	groups etc.) will not host, produce, nor participate in conferences, camps, 	fellowships, or other activities with churches or organizations which do not 	maintain a fundamental philosophy toward ministry and choose to use worldly 	attractions to draw people.

God forbids the stirring up of strife, the taking of revenge, or the threat or use of violence as a means of resolving personal conflict or obtaining personal justice. Although God commands us to abhor sinful actions, we are to love and pray for any person who engages in such sinful actions. (Lev. 19:18; Matt. 5:44-48; Luke 6:31; John 13:34-35; Rom. 12:9-10; 17-21; 13:8-10; Phil. 2:2-4; 2 Tim. 2:24-26; Titus 3:2; 1 John 3:17-18)",

      title: "Lawsuits Between Believers",
      content: [
        "We believe that Christians are prohibited from bringing civil lawsuits against other Christians or the church to resolve personal disputes.  We believe the local church possesses all the resources necessary to resolve personal disputes between members.  We do believe, however, that a Christian may seek compensation for injuries from another Christian’s insurance company as long as the claim is pursued without malice or slander.  (1 Cor. 6:1-8; Eph. 4:31-32; Matt. 18:15-17)",

        "We believe that God has given the church the great commission. It is to proclaim the Gospel to all nations so that there might be a great multitude from every nation, tribe, ethnic group, and language group who believe on the Lord Jesus Christ. As ambassadors of Christ, we must use all available means to go to the foreign nations and not wait for them to come to us.  (Matt. 28:19-20; Mark 16:15; Luke 24:46-48; John 20:21; Acts 1:8; 2 Cor. 5:20)",

We believe that God has established the tithe as a basis for giving, but that every Christian should also give other offerings sacrificially and cheerfully to the support of the ministries of the local church. We believe that a Christian relinquishes all rights to direct the use of his tithe or undesignated offerings once the gift has been made. (Gen. 14:20; Prov. 3:9-10; Acts 4:34-37; 1 Cor. 16:2; 2 Cor. 9:6-7; Gal. 6:6; Eph. 4:28; 1 Tim. 5:17-18; 1 John 3:17)",
